## Problem Statement

The #CreatiVerse Hackathon challenges teams to build AI tools that reshape global brand marketing. Projects can focus on creating scalable ad content, automating ad reviews, or analyzing ad performance to deliver data-driven insights. 

---

## Overview  

Our AI-powered web application that transforms website content into unique advertisement images. By analyzing a company's website URL, the app uses retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to extract key themes and generates contextually relevant marketing visuals using AWS Bedrock's Titan v2 model. Users can input custom prompts to further refine the AI-generated advertisement images, creating tailored visual content that reflects the essence of the website's brand and messaging.
